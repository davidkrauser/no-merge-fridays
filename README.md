This is a hacky firefox extension to disable GitHub merges on Fridays.

To use, clone this repository locally. Then open [about:debugging](about:debugging), click `This Firefox`, click `Load Temporary Add-on...`, then select the manifest file within this repository.

In the future, I may package this up and create a real release, but I haven't yet.
